# Part 1
## Description
We provide raw data from a fictitious company that manufactures and sells bicycle parts. As part of the training (Step 2), we ingest and prepare the company’s data following the Databricks medallion architecture. During this training we will ingest and clean the data using Databricks notebooks within the bronze layer and apply the company’s business logic in the silver layer. We will also learn how to orchestrate the process using Databricks workflows. In Step 3, we will learn about the final gold layer and dimensional models. Subsequently, we will dive into advanced Databricks concepts.
## what you learn  
  
- What is the medallion architecture?
- What is the bronze layer made of?
- What is the silver layer made of?
- How to access data using python notebooks?
- How to prepare and clean data using PySpark notebooks?
- How to orchestrate Databricks processes using workflows?
## Promises
By the end of the training, you’ll know industry standards managing data in Databricks. You will be able to connect to basic data sources and to prepare your data using PySpark. Further, you will be able to orchestrate your Databricks workloads.

## what you learn  

- What is the gold layer made of?
- What are dimensional models?
- How to create, complex, parameterized workflows?
- What is the Delta format?
- How can Delta tables be used to apply change-data-capture (CDC) along the medallion architecture?
- What is the unity catalogue?
## Promises
  
By the end of the training, you’ll be able to populate the entire medallion architecture. You will know about dimensional models and data provision for BI.
You will be able to optimize your processes by applying CDC and parameterizing your workflows. You will also be able to use the basic features of the unity catalogue.
