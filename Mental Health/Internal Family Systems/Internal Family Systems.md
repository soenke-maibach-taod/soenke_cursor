Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapy is an innovative psychotherapeutic approach developed by Richard C. Schwartz in the 1980s[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model). This non-pathologizing method is based on the concept that the human mind naturally consists of multiple "parts" or subpersonalities, each with its own perspective, beliefs, and emotions[1](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/internal-family-systems-therapy/)[5](https://psychology.org.au/for-members/publications/inpsych/2022/winter-2022/internal-family-systems-therapy). The core principles of IFS therapy include:

1. **Multiplicity of the Mind**: IFS recognizes that our psyche is composed of various parts, such as the inner critic or inner child[1](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/internal-family-systems-therapy/).
2. **Self-Leadership**: The therapy aims to help clients access their core "Self," which is characterized by qualities like compassion, curiosity, and calmness[1](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/internal-family-systems-therapy/)[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model).
3. **Positive Intention**: IFS posits that all parts, even those causing distress, have positive intentions for the individual[2](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/ifs-therapy).
4. **Healing Process**: The goal is to understand and heal wounded parts, bringing the internal system into harmony[1](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/internal-family-systems-therapy/)[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model).

IFS therapy is used to treat various mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression, PTSD, and eating disorders[1](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/internal-family-systems-therapy/). During sessions, therapists guide clients through a process of identifying, understanding, and working with their internal parts using techniques like the "six Fs" (Find, Focus, Flesh out, Feel toward, BeFriend, and Fear)[3](https://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types/internal-family-systems-therapy). This evidence-based approach has gained significant popularity in recent years, with many therapists considering it a powerful tool for promoting healing and self-understanding[5](https://psychology.org.au/for-members/publications/inpsych/2022/winter-2022/internal-family-systems-therapy).
