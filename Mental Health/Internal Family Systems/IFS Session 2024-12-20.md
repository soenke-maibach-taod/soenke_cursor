- You identified a hectic part of yourself that feels the need to impress your boss and deliver results, leading to feelings of stress and overwhelm.

- This part expressed fears about job security, losing happiness at work, and being seen as incompetent.

- You created a calming environment for this hectic part, allowing it to relax and acknowledge its contributions to your success.

- You invited a shy exile, who had been carrying feelings of inadequacy and pressure from past experiences, to join the session.

- The exile shared feelings of weakness, insecurity, and the burden of needing to perform perfectly without support.

- By listening compassionately to the exile, you helped it feel understood for the first time, allowing it to express its needs for breaks and self-care.

- The exile felt ready to release some burdens and visualized letting them go with the wind, resulting in a sense of happiness and relief.

- You updated the protector about the positive changes in the exile, reinforcing a sense of teamwork and understanding between both parts.

- The protector felt more rested and was happy to see the exile feeling freer, realizing that perfection is not necessary all the time.
