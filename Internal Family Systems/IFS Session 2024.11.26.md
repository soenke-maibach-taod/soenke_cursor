- **Start:** Two possible situations/trailheads
- **Situation 1:** Felt insecure about approaching someone at the gym
- **Underlying theme:** Feeling like I need to be or do more to be okay
- **Focused on:** Gym situation and the part urging me to hold back
- **Protector identified:** "Best friend" part, focused on avoiding rejection and protecting progress
- **Protector's fear:** Rejection confirming "unattractiveness," making future attempts harder
- **Exile identified:** Young boy hiding under the bed, lonely, afraid of being hurt by others
- **Exile's state:** Initially in pain, hiding, distrustful but became comfortable with presence
- **Resolution with exile:** Boy crawled out, wanted a hug, no longer in pain, confident, ready to enjoy life
- **Protector's response:** Happy and relieved, trusts the process for now
- **Session close:** Both parts seemed content; no further needs expressed at this time
