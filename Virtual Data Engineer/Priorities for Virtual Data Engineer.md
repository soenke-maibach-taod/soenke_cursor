#VDE
List of priorities

overarching goals:
- improve my standing at taod to be an automation wizard
- higher salary by insane productivity gains
- impress [[SAG]] to sign new contract
- impress taod to focus on Migration Projects in Sales

to get there:
- make my solution seem super complex to build
- make my solution seem to work insanely well and save brutal amounts of time
- be able to showcase my solution internally to impress people but give the impression of no one being able to replicate it

prios:
1. [DONE] get system running
2. optimize it with better modularization, data type enforcements, classes etc.
3. prepare mid level presentation of how it works
