Goal: New budget from [[SAG]] for [[SAG project 2024]] for the [[SAG Automation Process Overview]]
we had a discussion: [[Meeting SAG weitere Opportunities]]

we want to speak with [[Marius Borota]], [[Vladimir Sokol]], [[Ferdinand Bleschke]] by the end of next week

# Storyline
## Main Points
- We are currently developing an AI software for automating Data Engineering Tasks
- The software is designed for Migration Tasks
- Why migration tasks? Migrating from a legacy stack to a new one poses one major issue:
	- Devs are busy with recreating an existing solution. The opportunity costs are high because the development of new features is halted or slowed down
	- Also migration implies that by automatically comparing old and new outputs you get a reliable quality control for an otherwise less supervised automated system
- Software is still under development
- We have tested it in its current state. It brings roughly 50% improvement in the delivery speed of migrated models
- The software can take care of all tasks of our defined process:
	- Read the code
	- document it
	- simplify it
	- create code
- We've tested with data and code very similar to SAG's and the output quality matches or surpasses that of the manual development
