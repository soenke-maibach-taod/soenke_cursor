This project is a support project for my Obsidian notes.

Obsidian is a powerful note-taking application that stores notes as local Markdown files on your device. Its key features include:
Core Functionality
Local Storage: All notes are stored as plain text files, ensuring data ownership and accessibility
Bidirectional Linking: Creates connections between notes, allowing users to build a network of knowledge and visualize relationships through a graph view
The linking works by putting the title of an article (a markdown file) into double square brackets like [[title]]
Markdown Support: Uses Markdown formatting for text editing with real-time rendering

Notable Features
Knowledge Graph: Visualizes connections between notes, helping users discover patterns and relationships in their knowledge base


Technical Aspects
File Format: Uses standard Markdown (.md) files, ensuring compatibility with other applications
